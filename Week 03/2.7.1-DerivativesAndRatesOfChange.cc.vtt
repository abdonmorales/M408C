00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is section 2.7 derivatives and rates of change part one. So in this video, we are going to state 2 definitions of what we're going to call a derivative.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then we're going to relate the position function and the velocity function back to these things called derivatives.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So in the previous videos, I'm talking a long time ago. We had this way to describe the slope of a tangent line.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I'm going to use now our new limit notation, a limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a over x minus a.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And rank just so we have a picture in our head. Maybe here's my graph.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here is the x value a. Maybe we have some sort of Here is my F of X. And so here is the idea.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Here is NX value. And through this, I can find this secret line. I can find that slope.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Well, here is an X value that's a little bit closer. That's going to give me that point.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That's going to give me this secant line. And then I can pick maybe this. But then maybe I can take this x value that's a lot closer.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's gonna give me this secret line. And as I get closer and closer to A, I get the secret lines that get closer and closer to the tangent line.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So maybe if I let x approach a and get infinitely close. The results will be this tangent line and that's exactly what we're going to claim here.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If I take this limit the result is the slope of the tangent line. Now it turns out this thing right here is wildly important.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is something that we are going to be studying. A whole lot in this course. But because this expression is very, very, very important, it's going to get its own name.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And we're going to call this limit the derivative of f at x equals a. So I want to find the derivative of a function at x equals a.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We take the limit as x approaches a of this expression up above. And again, all this is doing is it's helping me find the slope.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Of the tangent line at x equals a. So let's let's do an example of this.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So I'm going to be very careful and use the definition I have up above. So f prime of 3.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Is the limit as x? Okay. Okay. That's minus.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:18.000
3 over X minus 3. That's the same thing as 2 X. Where whoops, the of 2 x where minus x.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Minus the quantity. 2 times 3 squared. Minus 3. Over x minus 3.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You keep going with this, so this is the limit. As x approaches 3 of. 2 x where minus x do some math here 9 18 minus 3 is 15.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Over x minus 3. I would love to just plug in 3 and be done. But when I plug in 3, this becomes.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
18 minus 3 is 15 over 15 is 00 man, this becomes 0 divided by 0. This is my indeterminate form.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So in that kind of thing happens in this class. One of our goats strategies is And I, This is X, probably minus.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:40.000
3 and plus. 5 and sure enough if I foil this out and double check my work, I get exactly the thing of perform.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This cancels. And I get a limit.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:05.000
As x to 3. Of 2 x plus 5 and wouldn't you know that is exactly Oh, That is exactly 11 and you know what that looks pretty good to me that seems like a totally reasonable answer.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
That seems like a totally reasonable answer. Now I promised you earlier that they were going to be 2 or that go 2 definitions of a limit.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Or seems to be 2 definitions of a derivative. So let me show you the second definition. So this second definition.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Is the limit as h approaches 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a over a plus h minus a.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Notice it's the same as this formula here. Except I've got a slightly different convention.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
No wanna show you what's happening. I'm gonna draw one more picture for us. This picture says if here is my function.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And I'm interested in the derivative at A. Well, let's consider the points. A and A plus H.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So see how that's going to give me maybe This secret line. When H is this value, but as H gets closer to 0.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I'm gonna get something more like this secant line. And as H gets closer to 0, it's gonna give me this secant line.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And the limit of this process is precisely. That tangent line right there. So it's the same idea.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Just a slightly different setup. Whether or not we're letting x approach a or letting h approach 0 and as h approaches 0, this quantity approaches a very similar, similar idea.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Let's do the exact same thing we did on the previous page and make sure we get the same answer.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So f prime of 3. Is the limit. As H approach to 0. Okay.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Minus f of 300, and I meant to point this out. So notice in, in my, denominator, I'm gonna take the first point.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:17.000
3 plus H. Minus the second point 3. And look at what happens and this happens up above this 3 and this 3 cancel gives me H.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And that's exactly what I have in this formula. Here I forgot to point that out. One nice thing about this form is that my denominator is always super simple.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Now let's look at the rest of this. How was this going to? Let me remind myself.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Was 2 x where minus. Okay, so if I'm computing this. I get the limit.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:58.000
As H approaches 0. Of 2. 3 plus h squared. Minus 3 plus h.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Minus 2 times 3 squared minus 3. Divided by 8. So I'm noticing this is a bit more chaotic.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000
There's a lot more going on here. I hope this works out. I bet it does. This is me 2 times.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:33.000
9 plus 6 8. Plus each where. Minus 3 minus h. Minus and let's see this quantity is.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:51.000
18 minus 3 is 15. All divided by H. This is the limit. As H approaches 0 of so let's see this is 18.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Plus 12 H. Plus 2 H squared. Minus 3 minus h minus 15 over h. Things are finally simplifying.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Things are finally simplifying. Notice. This 18 cancels with that 3 15 so 18 minus 3 minus 15 is 0.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And if I look at this, it looks like it is 2 8. Squared minus 11 H. Over 8.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I could try plugging in 0. That gives me 0 over 0. But that's no good.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.000
But like we've talked about all semester so far. I can factor something out. I can do some algebra.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Oh, sorry. But factor out the eighth and I get 2 8 plus 11. Divided by H. And I get a limit.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
As H approaches 0 of 2 8 plus 11. That gives me 0 plus 11. And how remarkable is that?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:14.000
That 11 is the same. The same as the answer I got using the other definition. So this is good.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I will say 2 things. Oftentimes they work here is not nearly as difficult. This definition, I think, is a little bit easier often times.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
This is a little more involved. There's a little more algebra that happens. And believe it or not, this is going to be key for what happens in the next.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:42.000
This is very important for us. We're really gonna lean into this definition here. in the next section.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000
One more thing we should talk about. So let's talk about what S prime is. So f prime of a.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
This is the slope of the. At the point x equals a. So that's weird to say, right?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Think about the slope of a function. The function might be a quadratic or exponential or trig.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We don't think of these curved functions as having a slope, but that's what we can think of.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:21.000
We can think of a function. Having a slope at a point and if that's a little too tough it's also perfectly fine to think of it as just the slope of the line tangent to the graph.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000
At that point. But it's another thing too. It's not just the slope, it's also the instantaneous rate of change of x.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So we were trying to measure how fast something is changing. We often want to take the derivative. So let's take a step back and ask this question.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:53.000
If I have the position function. S prime is the instantaneous rate of change of position, right? That's what that's what the derivative measures, the instantaneous rate of change.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But, conceptually, what is the instantaneous rate of change of position that is instantaneous velocity, right?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
If I'm measuring the rate of change of where a function is, well, we just call that velocity.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Which leads to this really important formula that relates to related ideas. The derivative of position is velocity. And one thing that's also true Is that the derivative of velocity is acceleration, right?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I can think about this as, what happens if you slam on the accelerator while you are your velocity, the speed of your car is going to presumably speed up, right?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000
You go from slow to fast, that is an acceleration. And similar, if you slam on the brakes and your velocity decreases presumably to 0, that is a negative acceleration or D accelerate.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So, so we have these these formulas for derivatives that we can route to these topics very often seen business.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Okay, so real fast. A car is traveling with position s of t equals 2 t squared minus t.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:15.000
How fast is this traveling at T equals 3? So we this. Right? We pick this because it's incredibly familiar.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:28.000
How fast is it traveling? At time 3 and I say how fast maybe I should just say what is the velocity of time 3 I don't want to worry about positive or negative what is the velocity at time 3?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Well, the velocity at 23. Is the derivative of the position function at time 3. But I've already done this before, right?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I've computed this derivative at 3 twice. It is 11 whatevers. We don't have units here.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So we'll just, we'll just call it.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Now I did all of this and there's this issue lurking in the background, right? So suppose I wanted the position, excuse me, suppose I wanted the velocity at time one and 2 and 3 and 4 all the way up to 10.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Does that mean I have to compute 10 different limits? Well, where we are right now, the answer is yes, that I don't have a good way of finding the derivative.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.000
At 10 different values. Aside from taking 10 different derivatives. And that's not, you know, if it didn't get better than this.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I don't know if I don't know if calculus really would have taken off the way it did.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So things are going to get a little bit better. They're going to get a little bit faster.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And the first thing we're going to see is that we shouldn't have to take a limit over and over and over again.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:48.000
But
