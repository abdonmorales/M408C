2.4, the precise definition of a limit. So in this video, we are going to quickly state the precise definition of a limit and then quickly try to understand what this means.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is by no means a super in depth video, but we certainly need to at least see the type of stuff that goes on behind the scenes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We're going to start with the function that is defined on some open interval containing A except possibly for A.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Which is a very complicated statement. All this means is there is some sort of function. There is some sort of A.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And in the function exist and is defined around a. Although it is possible for the function at A to not exist.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So it just prevents. Some weird things from happening. The function needs to be reasonably well-behaved.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Around a and it's also K if there's a hole at A. Okay, so then the limit of f of x as x approaches a is some number l.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Or we use this symbol. And what we've been saying so far is we've been a little, little hand wavy, you know, we've been saying as you and you slide into the X value, you kind of slide towards this Y value as you get infinitely close to X equals A, what F of X value do we get infinitely close to and that's that's been good enough for us

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.000
for now but at some point we have to become super, super precise. And here's the precise statement, the one that we agreed that we will all agree upon is the best definition.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Yes, for every number epsilon greater than 0, there is another number delta greater than 0 such that if the absolute value of x minus a is between 0 and delta, in the absolute value of f of x minus l is less than epsilon.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Whoa, that is that is there's a lot going on here y'all. This is a dense dense statement.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We are not going to spend any time really unpacking this. What I would like to do is give you some idea of how this works.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What is happening here and try to explain it on these 2 pictures? Now what you notice is that based on the things we talked about in this class and what we talked about is correct.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The limit on the left as x approaches a exists and the limit as x approaches a on the right does not exist.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And what we have said so far as well when you approach from the left and you approach from the right.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
They both approach L, so the limit exists. Here when you approach from the left and you approach from the right you approach 2 different values and so the limit does not exist.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Use or let's try to say the same thing, but we're gonna say using this.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This works. It's almost like it's almost like a game. If somebody hands you an So long is gonna be Somebody give you an epsilon.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Epsilon is . On some kind of values. And those.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
X value. So see how I started with this epsilon. We go epsilon above L.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We go epsilon below L. We kind of backtrack to our x-axis.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And then what we can do is say, look at this, be this small value here. Anytime I pick an X value in this interval.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Of Delta's it goes to a y value smaller than this inner full of delta, I admit that's a lot.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We throw in these Greek letters, there's a lot going on, and especially if we don't work any example problems, I think.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But for this video, I don't want to work any example problems. I wanna start with just a picture.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And so mind you, this is now when things are gonna get real. Maybe I'll zoom in a little bit.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000
What if you say, well, you know what, that epsilon felt too big. One if I had, Well, my smaller.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
In this way, it corresponds to even. Smaller. X values like this.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
In the what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pick a new That's inside of that.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Gee, that's small. Maybe that's the tiny little delta I pick. And now my little delta region when I map it.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Maps inside the new And it doesn't matter how tiny this epsilon gets. I can find an incredibly tiny delta that always somehow fits in.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And believe it or not, even though I don't feel like necessarily, that's exactly what it means for the limit.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Let's come over here because I think this may actually do a better job of explaining why this is.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So if I looked at this and I had to guess, right, if there were a, will the limits either going to be this value up here.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Or it's gonna be this value down here. Let's just assume it's this value up here when the function exists.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So suppose this is. Let's play the same game we played before. Well, I'm gonna take this.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Little epsilon value.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But watch what happens, okay, there's a small epsilon value. What exactly is the delta I'm gonna put?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Well, what I said is you need to kind of come over here. And try to find

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
What the corresponding region is and ISIS. You know, eventually this function might go up and might not.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But my real issue is right here. Because I'm not sure where if ever there's like a corresponding Here's where we're gonna see the If I take a delta, a very small number.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Maybe like this. Here's my belt. That's my other dog. And Okay.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
That sounds Nice fine. And the core funding value lies inside that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And then, on this side. That's all right. The problem is what happens. An X value on this side of that.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Well, I come up and it hits. This. And notice. Value is way outside my epsilon region.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And it doesn't matter how tiny. Delta gets, even if that delta is just barely, barely to the left.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Barely to the left of, I still have this issue of that my y value is going to be outside the epsilon region.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Well, why is it outside of this epsilon region precisely because it's not continuous precisely because there's this jump and that's what this definition is helping us pick up.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Is that this condition is not satisfied precisely when our bill sees that there's a, our eyeballs.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That there's a jump, but we can't just say that we need to somehow express that precisely mathematically and this, believe it or not, is the way to do it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So again, there are lots of tiny little issues we need to talk about. If we were going to talk about this in depth, lots of places to have a miss understanding.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This is a, this is no joke. But, this is the type of thing that oftentimes when you kind of veer into the world of your mathematics, you kind of get, you kind of get.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Put in this way
