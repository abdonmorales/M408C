This video for section 2.5 continuous functions. So in this video we will define We're gonna list some properties of functions and then describe some This this video is going to be lots of words and in the next video there will be more problems.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's just talk about what in the world a continuous function. What does it mean for a function to be continuous?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And there's just really fantastic. It has to be continuous at every point. Which I feel like as well.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Are we, What does it mean to be continuous? And I have 2 answers. The first answer, which feels okay.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Is that when you don't have to pick up your pen and part of me feels okay. First way to understand this.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I don't think it's the best way. I don't think it's the most complete way to understand this.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're gonna have a much better answer that we're going to be able to use in the class.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And it says, a function f is continuous at the point x equals a if the following is true. It says that the limit.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Of the function. Equals the value of the function when we plug in that same number. Now let's dissect this a little bit.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There there is a bit more going on here than perhaps we realize. The first thing that has to happen is that this number, this value has to A exist.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And it has to be finite. So we are not going to, for example, we can't plug in A and get one over 0.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We can't get the square root of negative 2. It has to be some finite thing. And something that exists.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We can't get into. Another thing that has to be true is that the limit has to exist and we've seen in this course that the limit only exists when the right hand limit and the left hand limit both exist.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And equal each other and in this case are finite. So in order for this to be true, there's actually a lot going on.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We have to check existence. The fact that it's finite, a left hand limit, right hand limit, the equality, the the finiteness, and then we can finally check do those 2 members.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So it's not, trivial. Now that's video and let or see the page and just.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Not continuous. So here, this is an example of a function that is not continuous at A. And the reason it's not continuous today is that and part of being continuous.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That the function must exist at A. Here we see that F of A does exist. The limit. Of F of X as X approaches A does not exist, right?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because we see the left hand limit does not equal the right hand limit. Here. The function is not continuous.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The limit exists. But the limit of is not the same as. So 3 perfectly fine functions that just happen to not be continuous in each case for different reasons.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Function does not exist, the function does not exist. A limit does not exist. The function and the limit exist, but they're not equal to each other.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But then if we put all this together, what does it mean for the limit or the function to be as well?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's like the function. Exist at the point. And the limit on the left. Equals the limit from the right and you're like, oh yeah, Okay, that the limits gets me to the point the point exists and the limit allows you to keep going without ever picking up my pen.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So here, the limit. Exist. So that's just a good, There's in our head and take the pictures and compare them to the conditions we have on the previous day.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Here's a nice little problem for us to consider. So we have some function. It's a piecewise function.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So it's x squared plus x minus 12. When x is not 3 and it equals to b when the function is 3.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Let's find the value of B that makes this continuous. In particular, continuous The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to step, and this is not going to be a great graph.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Of this function. I know that x squared plus x minus 12. So this is a parabola that opens up.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
May also have x minus 3, I guess, plus or looks like my, x intercept.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Equal 0. So that means And 1, 2, 3, 4. So this is where we're going to intersect the why I see maybe x-axis.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Oh, but then I realize, look at this. So x equals 3 and 4. This is great except for the fact that this function is not x squared plus x minus 12 at x equals So when I They get something like this.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I'm gonna have an open circle. And I'm gonna keep going, right? This is the graph of my first condition.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It is this parabola with this 1 point omitted. It is not continuous at 3 because the We just have to now figure out the value of B that will plug in this hole.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And I think it's pretty obvious. There's lots of possible values for B. There's only one, this one right here that makes it continuous.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So if B is equal to 3. That makes the limit. As x approaches 3. At the back.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Which is the limit as x squared plus x minus 12. Equal. B, which is 3, which is.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Sorry, 0, which is up of 3.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I hope that I hope that added or it made sense. Fit in with what we just did. Before I end this, I do want to talk about some properties of continuous functions, continuous functions.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Are the Part of it is just because. Part of it is just because continuous functions are so well behaved.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So we have that if F and G are continuous at a point. I can add the 2 functions, track the 2 functions, multiply the 2 functions, multiply the function by a constant.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I can even divide. And as long as these are both continuous. So are these new functions. With one exception.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I hope you caught this. We always have to be careful when we divide. So long as G of A.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Is not 0. So it's not the case, right? It's not the case that I can divide by 0.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So that's when we might get some some headaches, but otherwise we're allowed to whatever we want to continue with functions we will create new continuous functions.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
These functions are these properties with a few other facts. Mean that a whole lot of things are suddenly continuous function.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And this list is going to look super familiar. Polynomials are continuous functions. Rational functions are continuous functions.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Good. So long as you event is not. So these functions precisely where the denominator is not 0, these are continuous.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Root function so the in root of x these are continuous so long as the functions defined My trig functions are continuous, except, you know, like for example, tangent has a lot of places where you divide by 0.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So, so those are not continuous. Those points but they're also not defined at those points. So, Trink functions are continuous wherever they're defined.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Exponential function, inverse trig functions, logarithmic functions, See, turns out have this nice continuous property.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:55.000
The next video. Examples of continuous things and some of the interesting things that are a consequence of being continuous.
