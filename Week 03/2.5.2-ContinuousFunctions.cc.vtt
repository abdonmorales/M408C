00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hmm.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay. I mean, We're gonna stay and use the intermediate.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In the previous video, we talked about what happened. Multiply by functions and whether or not the result.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I think it's, maybe with the exception of beginning. Additional way to combine functions. When is that?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And here's the rules. It's particularly difficult although it looks a little overwhelming when we see it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The function G has to be. Okay. And the function f has to be continuous at g of a, then the result.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here are 3 functions. And these are functions, right? In each case, we have a function, for example, 2 x minus 3 sitting inside of the square root function.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We have x over x minus one taking inside of the sine function. We have the square root function spin inside of e to the Yeah.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And so let's take a look and determine if these 3 functions are continuous. At one. So what I'm going to do is I'm first going to look at the inside function.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Using the notation we have up above. I my phone. Equal to x minus 3. And I see that if I plug in one.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This is like a totally reasonable answer. Not one. D of one equals 2. This is negative one. I was silly.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Sorry about that. If I plug one into 2 X minus 3. Totally reasonable, nothing surprised the limit exists.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The function exists at the point. We get negative one. Okay. So now this.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Is my new value and I'm going to ask is the function f of x the bigger function. What happens if I bug in?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
What happens if I plug in this negative one? And that's where we see we get something like the square root of negative one.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And this does not exist, so we are not. Continuous.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So it's a little weird, right? We have to kind of follow the number, follow the input and see what happens.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000
X started at one when I plugged one into the function, the one becomes negative one and the square root of negative one is not a thing we do in this class.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So this is not continuous.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Yeah. Now the second case, I'm gonna use the same. The inside function is x over x minus one.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so when I plug in one, I get something that is very undefined. Right? We're gonna say that does not because I cannot plug in one over 0 does not make sense.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And since this does not exist, since this function is not continuous at one. The entire function. Minus one.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Is not continuous. Act equals one. So, you know, when is a position of functions not continuous?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Well, there's sort of 2 ways that can be not continuous. It can be not continuous right away because of that insight function.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Or perhaps we plug in the input. The input turns into a new number and then that outside function is not continuous at that new number.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And it's one position of G of X is. We already back. And so when I plug in one, I get the root of one with this one.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And then, Could be apps. And so I'm going to plug in.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
My new number?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And E to the X is a perfectly continuous function at x equals one. I plug in the results. You that nothing weird happens, no holes, no discontinuities, no asymptotes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
. So therefore, Hmm.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.000
X equals one. So the proposition in the functions is a couple of things to check that not quite as simple as what we had before with addition to, the multiplication in the, but it is certainly nothing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Wildly difficult. We just have to be a little bit. Now the third part of this video takes a, a sort of.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Let's talk about this thing that at least initially feels very theoretical. It's this thing called the intermediate value theorem.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Let's start by kind of speaking. So suppose we have a function that is continuous. On some interval A to B.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So now finally in this fifth section of chapter 2 we can use this word continuous. With a fair amount of certainty that we understand what it means.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And let N be any number between F of A and F of B where these 2 numbers are not equal.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This would not be a whole lot of sense or maybe we'd have to refine this a little bit.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000
If these 2 numbers are equal. So let's assume we have this interval, it starts at A, it ends at B, it contains those endpoints.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And when we plug in A and we plug in B, the result is 2 different numbers. Okay, well then there is an X value C such that.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:47.000
C is between A and B. And when I plug in C into the function, I get that number N, which is between F of A.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:59.000
That's all. Let's describe what this means. So here, let's.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Let's have the. So this is the interval. I'm looking at. Let's say this is my app.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And And this up here is my app. Oh, Let's put that over here.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Over here. This is my app over here on the y-axis. Let's extend this a little bit.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And so now what we're going to draw. From this point to this point. Is according to my theorem, I'm curious what happens when I draw a continuous function.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We have this very nice, useful, precise definition about limits and value of function at a point, equaling the limit.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Oh, line, you know, in our gut, it means don't pick up your pencil and don't have anything too wild happening.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So I'm gonna start here. And I'm gonna draw this graph, maybe it goes up a little bit.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Maybe it goes down.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Maybe it goes back. You know, those infinite number. But I'm gonna draw And here's what the, what the intermediate value fear. The intermediate values theorem says start with any number.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Between F of A and F of B. So I'm going to pick. I don't know.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:43.000
That looks like a perfectly reasonable number. There's my N. The the claim is that well then there must be some X value which we will call C.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Such that C is between these 2 points and The value of f of c is n. And so when you draw this picture nicely, you see right away.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Then if I go this way. Corresponds to this way sure enough here it is There is my C, this value is between A and B and if I plug in C to my function, I get the value F of C equals N.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Okay, what if I tried something up here? I'm gonna call this and 2 is for the second value of n.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well notice here it looks like I have a couple values of C, right? I could have picked. This value of C.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So that's one value of C. Or I could have picked that looks like this value. Let's see.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Or it looks like maybe eventually, might even be a third one. Yeah, let's write it back here.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Is it okay that I have multiple values of C that satisfy these property that these 1 2 3 value to see are between A and B.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And if I plug any one of these into the function, I get into back. Is that okay? Absolutely.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
That's okay. The intermediate value theorem just says there is at least one C. Turns out there's lots of ways to get back to this N 2.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:21.000
What's interesting? Because this function is continuous there was at least one of them. Now warning, this does not say.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Is that if you pick an X value between A and B, you are guaranteed a Y value between F of A and F of B.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And I wanna point that out right here. This is a perfectly fine value between A and B. But if I hit If I looked at its output, see how the output F of this C.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Is actually going to be outside of this Y interval. Is that okay? Is that is that held?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Is this somehow counter to the description we have. And the answer is this is totally fine because the way the intermediate value theorem works is it says you start on the y-axis between f of a and f of b.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And when you start between F of A and F of B, you can find an X value between A and B that gets you back to that value.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
What you can't do is start on the x-axis and be guaranteed to end up between A and B.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Thank you start on the Y-axis jump to the. You know, move to the excess.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And I suppose now Why this is Is let me So here is A. Here is what I'm going to do.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And this picture right here is function.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:11.000
It just so happens to not be continuous, right? It is very not continuous right here. And I'm gonna draw.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:24.000
This is And why does suddenly the intermediate value theorem fail to be true? Well, this looks like a pretty great value.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And is between A and B. If this function work continuous, then I would be able to find an X value C.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:47.000
That gives me back to that value end. But notice that value doesn't exist here. If I try to find the X value, I'm gonna fly right through that point and there's just no X value, right?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
There's no X value. That's gonna get me to that exact value.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And that's the issue with when you have something that's not continuous, then the intermediate value theorem might not or is not going to necessarily be true.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So we'll like to track this, class again. But let me show you kind of an interesting example.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Suppose, oh, show there is a solution to this 1, 2, 3, 4, fifth degree polynomial.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I suspect you are not solving Yes, degree polynomial. Linear things absolutely. Quadratic things of course.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Cubic fourth degree fifth degree. Very unlikely. In fact, I'm quite certain that this is not something you would solve.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And actually, as I said here today, I don't know if I can solve. And actually, as I sit here today, I don't know if I can solve this.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This is a, this is a uniquely difficult thing in the world of mathematics. Why am I showing this to you now?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
What? That's x to the fifth minus x plus one. This is just a polynomial.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And I know, are continuum. Right, this is a continuous function. I work too. Look at the graph of this function.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Let's suppose I want to find the value of one. Well, if I plug in one, that's the same thing as the y.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And it's going to be this point right here. But then look at what happens when I plug in one.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000
One to the fifth is one. Minus 5 plus one. I think I get this become negative 3.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:48.000
One minus 5 plus one. If I think about this as a function, if my input is one, my output is negative 3.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And so my graph looks. What does this function do between x to the fifth? What does this function do?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The, and x equals one. Well, I don't know. You know, up to the fifth.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000
That can be kind of a wild thing. Go up and down a lot, have a couple of these peaks and valleys.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:23.000
But I know it's continuing. Maybe it's going up for a little bit, maybe. Now, And then it continues on and on and on.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But notice this is One, this is. Negative 3. So I'm guaranteed by the intermediate value theorem.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I should be able to pick. Any value between in one and negative 3. I think this really important one.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:00.000
0. And now the question is. Hey, does this equation ever equal 0 between negative one? Well, since we start above 0.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And I end below 0. And this is a continuous function. I know by the along here. A value of C between 0 and one for which f of c

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Equals 0. But that's the same value that's going to make this 0. You know?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Yeah, minus 5. 0. As a. Between x equals 0 and x equals one.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Do I know what the solution is? I do not. But sometimes just knowing that a solution exists is good enough for us.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And this is a way for me to say that because I start above 0, I end below 0. And I can start with 0 and know that there's no jumps, nothing weird happening with the.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000
That in fact I know that that value between 0 one exists that I know for that. At this 0 makes this fifth degree polynomial 0.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I know the floor is a solution. Powerful thing. Later on. Question what else are there more applications to the Are there more things you need to say about continuously?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Okay
